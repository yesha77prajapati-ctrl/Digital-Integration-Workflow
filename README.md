# Digital Integration and Workflow Automation Project

This project was developed as part of my postgraduate studies in the **Master of Information Technology (Enterprise Management)** at the **University of South Australia**. It focuses on improving workflow efficiency and interoperability across digital platforms using automation tools.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to streamline data flow between construction management platforms and automate routine processes. The solution aimed to enhance collaboration and accuracy in digital engineering environments.

## Key Responsibilities
- Gathered and analyzed business requirements to identify workflow inefficiencies.  
- Designed and modelled process flows to support system interoperability.  
- Validated automated workflows through iterative testing and stakeholder feedback.  
- Prepared technical documentation to support implementation and handover.

## Tools & Technologies
- Autodesk Construction Cloud  
- Revizto  
- Microsoft Power Automate  
- SharePoint  
- Microsoft Excel  

## Outcome
The project improved process visibility, reduced manual intervention, and enhanced data consistency across platformsâ€”supporting more efficient decision-making and collaboration in digital construction workflows.

## About Me
